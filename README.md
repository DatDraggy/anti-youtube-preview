Loads infinitely long when activating plugins. Plugins will still get activated. (maybe somebody could fix that? No idea why that happens)

Anti Youtube Preview
====================

Plugin for [YOURLS](http://yourls.org).

Description
-----------
This Plugin removes the ugly youtube preview from telegram and similar programs.
I use this if I want to show somebody a part of a video where the title/thumbnail
might be too weird or something like that.

Installation
------------
1. In `/user/plugins`, create a new folder named `anti-youtube-preview`.
2. Drop these files in that directory.
3. Go to the Plugins administration page ( *eg* `http://sho.rt/admin/plugins.php` ) and activate the plugin.
4. Have fun!

Use it freely, modify it, rape it, I don't care but don't try to sell it :P
